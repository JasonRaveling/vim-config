# vim-config
When I started using Linux, I used `vim`. Then I thought, IDEs were the way to go. After years of being away, I'm going back to `vim` and will see if it sticks.

The configs here are targeted toward web development (mostly PHP, SCSS & CSS), BASH scripting, Python scripting, and whatever else I encounter. Hopefully this will 
become a well rounded config.
